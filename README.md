## About Me

Hey there! I'm Sprunglicious, a passionate software enthusiast and open-source advocate. I'm excited to share my journey in the world of technology through my GitHub contributions. Currently, I'm actively involved in the development of a flavour of XeroLinux of which has not been announced, as it is a work-in-progress and needs to be okayed by DarkXero. XeroLinux is an Arch-Linux-based project that aims to bring a powerful, simple, and user-friendly distribution to the community. My goal is to contribute to making XeroLinux, and the open-source ecosystem more accessible and valuable for everyone.

## XeroLinux Super Secret Project [XSSP]

[XeroLinux](https://xerolinux.xyz) is a community-driven project that focuses on creating a stable and well-versed Linux distribution for the community. As an very minor and new contributor, I'm deeply engaged in developing and enhancing this Super Secret Project, which is simply meant for enancing the user experience and adding more choice to the XeroLinux project, a wide range of software choices.

## Get Involved!
